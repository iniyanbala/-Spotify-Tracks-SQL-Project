- ***Audio Features***: How do energy and danceability vary across genres?

- ***Popularity Trends***: Which tracks have a popularity higher than the average popularity of all tracks?

##  SQL Features Used

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions: `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`
- String filtering with `LIKE`
